# Island Model

The island model provides diversity maintainence by segregating the population into pools. These pools, islands, are evolved in isolation for a certain number of generations, an epoch, then migration occurs. This migration moves a number of individuals, chosen using a selection policy, to an adjacent island. This cycle of evolution followed by migration repeats until the termination condition is reached.

Parameters
* Number of Islands
* Epoch Duration
* Migration policy
