## Evolutionary Algorithms for evolving PSK constellations

Each folder contains the algorithm that is specified in the folder, along with the customized scripts used to plot data or create animations from data from that particular algorithm. The simulation files are also in each folder to make running easier, but also in a separate folder.

### Running

The evolutionary code is written in Python and uses Numpy, Scipy, and Matplotlib. The simulation is built on GNU Radio 3.7, and requires that to be installed to run. The movie maker scripts require ffmpeg.
